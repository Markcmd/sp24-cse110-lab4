1. values added:  20
2. final result:  20
3. values added:  20
4. ReferenceError: result is not defined. <br> Because result is declared within the if block using let, which means it cannot be accessed outside of that block due to JavaScript's block-scoping rules.
5. TypeError: Assignment to constant variable. <br> Becasue const result = 0; declares result as a constant, which means its value can't be changed. However, the next line tries to reassign result with result = num1 + num2;, which will throw an error because you can't reassign a constant. So the program will be terminated at line 7, if remove line 7 the line 9 will return "values added: 0"
6. Even if the above error is fixed (for instance, by changing const to let), console.log('final result: ', result); will throw an error because result is declared within the if block, and with const (or let), it is block-scoped and not accessible outside that block.
